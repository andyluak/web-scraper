A slightly rockered tail maintains the power and stability of a traditional board but helps keep the tail catch-free initiating turns and landing switch.",

The arch begins there and reaches it's highest point around the back foot, and it ends at the widest point of the tail. When a rider stands on the board, the arch flexes and the area ahead of the front foot rises for more lift in deeper snow.",
