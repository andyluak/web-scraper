		"description": "Gentemstick’s radical acceleration camber eliminates hooking and prevents nosedives in deep powder or fresh snow while maintaining natural flotation. It is designed and shaped to perform its best when the rider stands neutrally on top of a board. It is flat from the widest point of the nose to about the front foot. The arch begins there and reaches it's highest point around the back foot, and it ends at the widest point of the tail. When a rider stands on the board, the arch flexes and the area ahead of the front foot rises for more lift in deeper snow.",
