		"description": "The Jones Youth Solution Splitboard is a sized-down splitboard for the smaller set with full-blown adult level features and quality. When the grom is ready for the transition into the backcountry, it's essential to get them geared up right, and trusting Jones to get it dailed is a no-brainer - they've been doing it longer than anyone. A host of subtle touches guarantee better grip while skinning, easier turn transitions in variable snow, and more powerful downhill performance when it's all together. A great solution for bigger kids and smaller adults.",

Bataleon's standard 3BT™ uplifted sidebases adds some extra buoyancy and smooth turn initiation so they'll still be ripping laps when your old legs give out.",
