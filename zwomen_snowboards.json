The Burton Family Tree Hometown Hero Snowboard is the choice of superlocals, hidden stashers, and all-season slashers. Designed to blast through bunk and lay waste to chunk on its way to the holy land of deep funk, the Hometown Hero is an all-around ripper's ride. A moderately stiff flex and directional camber profile combine with a little taper and a lotta setback for a ride that lays the hammer through pow and crud alike.

		"description": "They say a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. And for snowboarding, that first step is a heck of a lot easier on the Arbor Ethos Snowboard. This snowboard is the perfect platform on which to perfect the craft of sliding sideways on frozen water. It has a fully rockered profile, which means the edges curve away from the snow instead of towards it, so turn initiation is easy and catch free. The flex of the board is smooth and soft for easy rideability, and the build itself is done as sustainably as possible, which doesn't do anything to make the board easier to ride, but does make it easier for all of us to keep riding further into the future. That's a big win for everyone!",
